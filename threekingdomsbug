Bug/error being reported:anytime i click manual download it sends me to that link.... idk why it sends me tons of random symbols and letters
Steps to reproduce:log into my account use microsoft edge and try to download any mods for three kingdoms
Expected result: download pop up like fallout or skyrim manual downloads
Actual result: crazy url with symbols and no attempt to download
Link to the affected mod/image (if relevant): all mods of three kingdoms. side not im a premium user and i suspect thats making me get a premium link to download the mod but it fucks up halfway bc there is no better download for the brand new mods and i get sent to that crazy url
